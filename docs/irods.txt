iRODS stands for Integrated Rule Oriented Data Systems. It is the next generation data grid solution allowing a user to access files from an online file system, near-line tapes, relational databases, and the web without worrying about where the data are actually located. The policies for managing data at the server level are hard-coded. Also, if users want to perform complex operations or data workflow, they need to script or program this at the client level.

Useful Commands:
 kinit - to initialise your account
 ipwd - to give the working directory
 ils - to list the files in the working directory
 icd - to change directory
 iget - get a file
 imeta - add, remove, list, or query user-defined Attribute-Value-Unit triplets metadata

There are more commands


imeta command - used to find data and list attributes of data ( e.g finding the tag names )

For our case to list all the bam files for a run we are intersted in run the following command:
/software/irods/icommands/bin/imeta qu -z seq -d id_run = 12529 and lane = 3 and target = 1

broken down:
qu - query object with specific metadata values  ( e.g for a specific run and lane ) 
-d attributes to look at 
-z zone, for us thats seq


then to get meta info on a specific file
/software/irods/icommands/bin/imeta ls -d /seq/12529/12529_3#1.bam

the -d flag points to a specific file
You can optionally specify a attribute name to only get that information:
/software/irods/icommands/bin/imeta ls -d /seq/12529/12529_3#1.bam tag
